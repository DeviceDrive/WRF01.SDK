# Arduino M0 Pro Bootloader
## Description
This is the alternative bootloader for Arduino M0 Pro.
Is able to update firmware via USB Native port and UART using Stk500 protocol.  
Source project comes from: https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd/tree/master/bootloaders/mzero

This bootloader implements the tap on Reset button. By pressing this button, the board will reset and stay in bootloader, waiting for communication on either USB or USART by 8 second. After this time bootloader try start user application.
The USB port in use is the USB Native port, close to the Reset button. 

The USART in use is labelled respectively RX/TX.
Communication parameters are a baudrate at 9600, 8bits of data, no parity and 1 stop bit.
